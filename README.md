The project introduces a software-based solution for secure and smart inventory control, with a unique focus on real-time insights through interactive dashboards. Leveraging AI-powered object detection and tracking, the system analyzes warehouse operations in real time by processing data from cameras and sensors. It identifies misplaced items, detects anomalies, and provides instant alerts to staff. Advanced algorithms and clustering techniques ensure accurate anomaly detection and positional tracking. What sets our solution apart is the integration of dynamic dashboards , offering actionable insights that empower warehouse managers to address issues proactively and optimize operations. Seamlessly integrated with warehouse management systems, this software improves efficiency, reduces human errors, and enhances security, paving the way for smarter, data-driven warehouses.
